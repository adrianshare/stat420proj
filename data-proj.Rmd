Quick Notes:

Build a model of touchdowns

- Categorical Variable - `FantPos` {RB,WR,TE}
- Number of observation - 622
- Number of variables - 33


Touchdowns are a major factor in the overall fantasy score for a player. A good model of touchdowns will allow us to pick good players based on projections for the upcoming season.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
fantasy18 <- read_csv("fantasy18.csv", 
    skip = 1)
```




```{r}
str(fantasy18)
```








Simple plot of total touchdowns vs targets as an initial verification


```{r}
fan_mod <- lm(TD_3~Tgt, data = fantasy18)
plot(TD_3~Tgt, data = fantasy18)
abline(fan_mod)
```
